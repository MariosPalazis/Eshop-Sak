   CLOSED: [2021-01-13 Wed 14:41]
  no user logged in
  no shopping cart by anynomous session
  user logs in
  Does user have a shopping cart?
  yes -> load it

** TODO case 2
   no user logged in
   shopping Cart by anonymous session exists
   user logs in
   server asks the user if the anonymous session shopping cart wants to be added to his already existing shopping cart.
   yes -> add the anonymous shopping cart
   no -> do not add the anonymous shopping cart but it must be kept for when the user logs in.
** TODO case 3
   anonymous user
   adds products to the shopping cart
* the shopping Cart process
  when iam adding a product to the cart but that product already exists i just want to increment it.
  if that product is not in the cart iam fetching it from the database and adding it to the cart

** the cart data structure
   its an array of objects
   each object has two properties
   one being the actual product itself as stored in the database
   and the other being the ammount

   [
     {
       product: {},
       amount: 1
     },
     {

  when locally a user can register:
  - email
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - password

  when with third party:
  - firstName

** what can go wrong

   A user might have forgotten that he has registered with socials
   and try and create a new account with the same email
   that he has registered.

*** handling that case:
    User might be notifiied with a flashMessage that the email
    has been registered through a social app and that's why there
    is no password, therefore if i send him an email to that address
    and he verifies that indeed it is him, he could be provided with
    an option to create a password and effectively switch the login/reg
    method to a local one.

* plan
- open registration handlebars file.
- check what data is being sent to the server, yes.
- is there even a fetch? yes.

*** on registration failure
    no matter the url origin of a user at the time of his landing to the registration page
    a failed registration always redirects back to the registration page
*** on registration success
    from the checkout/login -> checkout/address
    from register -> /home
*** plan
    the checkout/address must be attaching a query string
    when a users selects the registration proccess

    then the /register page will be attaching that query string
    to the post fetch

    that means however that the loginLocal function that currently
    draws the origin of a url from req.originalUrl must be changed
    to accomodate the new method. However the local login proccess is
    dependent on the value of req.originalUrl, so any change will have
    to take that into consideration and make the appropriate changes
    to those files that are dependent or create that dependency.



    -> files creatating the dependency:
    public/js/login.js
    controllers/login.js

    <- files that need to create the appropriate structures to accomodate the
    new reality:

    public/js/register.js
    public/js/checkout_address.js



**** which routes can a user access the register page
     from /home
     from /checkout/login
     from /login

     wherever a login component exists the actual anchor that redirects
     to the register page is in:

     /views/partials/login.js

     and the javascript file that is imported by the partial

     /public/js/login.js

     intercepts the click event, prevents its default behavior and creates
     a new url adding a query string.

     That query string is the location that the registration proccess conceptual starts
**** login routes
     from /checkout/login
     from /login
**** DONE have the checkout address create a query string and attaching it
**** DONE have the loginLocal page use that variable stored in req.session.urlOrigin

** TODO registration with the social apps

** TODO check unsuccessfull login and registration proccesses work as they are supposed to
** TODO check if that user is registered with social apps
* What does a registration mean?
A user is created in the database
That same user is logged in

full name is divided into first and last.
